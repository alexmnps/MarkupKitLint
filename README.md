# MarkupKitLint
Linting and validation utilities for [MarkupKit](https://github.com/gk-brown/MarkupKit) integrated into Xcode.

1. [Getting started with `mklint`](#mklintsh)

## mklint.sh

`mklint.sh` is a script which validates your project's MarkupKit XML files and reports any issues it finds right **in Xcode's Issue Navigator**, and highlights the actual offending line in the text editor. It makes use of Xcode's **Build Phases** to provide this integration.

In its current (most basic) form, `mklint.sh` passes through to `xmllint` and currenly only provides basic XML syntax checking.

### Setup

#### 1. Open a terminal & `cd` into your Xcode project's root directory
```sh
cd ~/Developer/YourAwesomeApp/
```

#### 2. Download `mklint.sh` into this directory

You can use the following cURL snippet to do so in one line:
```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jarrroo/MarkupKitLint/master/Scripts/mklint.sh ; chmod +x mklint.sh
```

#### 3. Xcode: Add Build Phase to your app's target

1. Open the `Project Navigator` pane in Xcode (Cmd+1) & select your project
2. Open the `Build Phases` tab
3. Add a new `Run Script Phase`
4. Type the following command into the shell box:

```sh
./mklint.sh
```

#### 4. That's it

Now, whenever you build your project, the linter will run and highlight any issues it finds right inside Xcode.
